# copilot-android-product-list

Build a product list app step-by-step using Github Copilot

**Prerequisites**
- Android Studio
- Java JDK 17+

**Project structure**

Exercises are in the `exercise` folder for each step.

Each `exercise` folder contains the code written so far. Read through the `todolist.txt` file to elaborate a prompt for each step. 

If you get stuck or want to see the final result of each step you can take a peek at `solution` folder, in order to compare your work. Here you can also find the chat transcription used to obtain the code. 

If you want to push your solutions, create a fork of this project ðŸ˜Š
